![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

It was a fun challenge by
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

The challenge was to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

-  See all countries from the API on the homepage
-  Search for a country using an `input` field
-  Filter countries by region
-  Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-  Click through to the border countries on the detail page
-  Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Tailwind css
-  CSS custom properties
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i have learn many things. It was a fun project for me, I have now a better understanding in tailwind and javascript moreover i wanted to implement infinite scrolling but the api doesn't support limit and page prompt. And i have implemented some small things that weren't mention in challenge like scroll-to-top button, stay on dark or light mode using localStorage, search by name etc
